<h1>Pulled Pork</h1>

<h2>Description: Pulled Pork</h2>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Pork shoulder: Pork shoulder is perfect for pulled pork because it’s inexpensive, forgiving to work with, and tends to have a lot of marbling (which means it’ll result in tender meat). An 8-pound pork shoulder roast should make about 20 servings.</li>
    <li>Apple cider: A simple apple cider brine ensures irresistible flavor and tender, juicy pulled pork.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Use a blend of white and brown sugars for the rub. </li>
    <li>Seasonings: The sweet and savory rub is flavored with kosher salt, paprika, onion powder, ground black pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
    <li>Hickory chips: You’ll need three cups of soaked hickory chips for your smoker. </li>
    <li>Onion: An onion gives the pork even more bold flavor as it smokes. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Brine the pork shoulder.</li>
    <li>Pour the brine into the water pan of the preheated smoker with wood chips.</li>
    <li>Add the onion and ¼ cup of the rub.</li>
    <li>Season the pork with the remaining rub.</li>
    <li>Smoke the pork until tender.</li>
    <li>Let cool before shredding.</li>

</ol>
